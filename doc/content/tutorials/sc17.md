# Supercomputing 2017

In 2017, we presented a half-day tutorial on SENSEI.
The [course materials](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/5a007cb58d777f31ac64ddfd/folder/5a049b808d777f31ac64e77d)
are available here:

+ [Slides (PDF, 4.2 MB)](https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5a049b958d777f31ac64e77f/download)
+ [Virtual machine disk image (OVA, 14.6 GB)](https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5a05c53c8d777f31ac64ed11/download)

The disk image can be used with VirtualBox to try SENSEI out
without having to build it yourself.
However, once you decide to use it with your simulation,
you should build it yourself to avoid the overhead of a virtual machine
