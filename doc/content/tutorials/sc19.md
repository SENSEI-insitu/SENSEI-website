# Supercomputing 2019

In 2019, we are presenting a tutorial on SENSEI on Sunday, November 17th.
See [the SC19 program](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut141&sess=sess199) for details.
Some course materials are now available:

+ [slides (PDF, 345 MiB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nCH5m-WKlgB0Gl20MlkR0gOwUdzjGelY)
+ a [virtual machine disk image (OVA, 7.3 GiB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uF8357yAEy82eKY26doPWr1waNf56YZp)

The disk image can be used with VirtualBox to try SENSEI out
without having to build it yourself.
However, once you decide to use it with your simulation,
you should build it yourself to avoid the overhead of a virtual machine.

For those who attend the tutorial at Supercomputing,
we plan to have temporary accounts and a small reservation set up on
[Cori @ NERSC, a real supercomputer,](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/cori/)
that you can use to try out SENSEI during the tutorial!
We have found this a useful way to provide access to SENSEI
without large downloads.
